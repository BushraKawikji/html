    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a fresh Software Engineering graduate from The Hashemite University, where I ranked first in my major with a GPA of 3.84.
        I’m passionate about technology, design, and helping others learn. I have experience in Flutter development, Firebase, and UI/UX design using Figma and FigJam. 
        I also trained as a manual tester at Futeric and participated in the HTU Java Pathway, where I learned about OOP, debugging, and preparing for Oracle certification.
        I also worked as a Content Officer at the IT and AI Forum.
