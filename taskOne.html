    <h1>Name: Bushra Qaweqji</h1>
    <h2>Age: 22</h2>
    <h3>Major: Software Engineering</h3>
    <p>
        I’m a fresh graduate from The Hashemite University, ranked first in my major with a GPA of 3.84.
        I have a strong passion for volunteering, and I’ve been an active member of a college-based volunteer team.
        I also served as a Content Officer at the IT and AI Forum.
        I’m truly excited to be part of Orange Coding School, and I’ll do my absolute best to become a coach in this amazing program :)
